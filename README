Movist README

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

The Movist open source project ceased in 2010 and the original repository 
hosted at http://code.google.com/p/movist/ was abandoned.  

As of August 24, 2015, Google Code became read-only and I imported the code
here for posterity and possible forked development.  I say forked because
the original developers discontinued the open source project on Google Code
and but continue to develop a binary only version of Movist found at the 
Mac App Store. Please support them if you use and enjoy Movist:
